# 🚀 Quick Deploy Guide

## I can't directly deploy for you, but here's the fastest way to get it done:

### Option 1: Use the deployment script (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the deployment script I created
./deploy.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual deployment (if script doesn't work)

#### Step 1: Install Node.js (if not installed)
- Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest version
- Install it on your system

#### Step 2: Install Firebase CLI
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

#### Step 3: Create Firebase Project
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Click "Create a project"
3. Name it "prompt-context-server"
4. Enable Firestore Database and Cloud Functions (upgrade to Blaze plan - free tier included)

#### Step 4: Deploy
```bash
cd firebase-integration
firebase login
firebase init
# Select your project
# Choose Functions and Firestore
firebase deploy
```

### Option 3: Use Firebase Web Interface (No CLI needed)

1. **Create Firebase Project** at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. **Enable Firestore**: Go to Firestore Database → Create database
3. **Enable Functions**: Go to Functions → Get started (upgrade to Blaze plan)
4. **Copy the function code**: 
   - Go to Functions in Firebase Console
   - Create new function
   - Copy the code from `firebase-integration/firebase-functions/functions/index.js`
5. **Deploy directly in the web interface**

## 🎯 What happens after deployment:

1. **You'll get function URLs** like:
   ```
   https://us-central1-your-project.cloudfunctions.net/collectRequirements
   ```

2. **Copy these URLs** and update your Lovable project

3. **Copy the components** from `firebase-ready-components/` to your Lovable project

4. **Your app is live globally!** 🌍

## 🆘 Need help?

If you run into issues:
1. Make sure Node.js is installed
2. Make sure you have a Firebase account
3. Make sure you've upgraded to the Blaze plan (required for Cloud Functions)
4. Check that all files are in the right directories

Your Firebase setup is ready to deploy! 🔥
